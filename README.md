# CUADS Data Set
Source code used to process, clean and publish the CUADS DataSet

The dataset and instructions to gain access can be found here: [CUADS on IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/clarkson-university-affective-dataset-cuads)

The source code is being prepared for release and will be published here prior to publication of the Descriptor: Clarkson University Affective
Research Dataset (CUADS) submitted to the IEEE Data Descriptors journal.

# About This Code
This source was used to process the raw data captured from the Shimmer3 ExG, Shimmer3 PPG, and ARDT Mobile Application to produce the CUADS Dataset, and to perform quality assessment on the data. The raw data from the Shimmer3 devices are not provided in the dataset, but these scripts are provided for reference.

The `CUADS_Data_Quality.ipynb` notebook can be used with the distributed dataset, and is the source used to produce quality and validation metrics from the Data Descriptor.
